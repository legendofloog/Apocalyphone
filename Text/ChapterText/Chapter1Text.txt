[OpenRight][OneLineBox]
So[.,] find anything Name?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
We might be in luck[..] I saw[N]
some old logging hamlet[..][AN]
There's a few terrors roaming[N]
around but nothing too serious.[AN]
Might have some supplies that[N]
people haven't scrounged yet.[A]

[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]
At least it isn't bandits[..][N]
Revenants are predictable[.,][N]
they always want you dead.[AN]
People though[.?] You never know[N]
what they might be thinking[..] And[N]
it never feels good to fight em'[..][A]

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Speak for yourself Name[..] You can[N]
reason with people y'know[.?][AN]
The monsters just make me wonder[N]
if the Gods are still alive.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][TwoLineBox]
You're sure there's going[N]
to be supplies Name?[A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I mean is that ever a guarantee[.?][N]
But if there is I can find it.[A]

[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
But if there isn't then we'll[N]
risk getting killed by terrors[N]
without getting anything.[A]

[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I think we have to try[..] If we[N]
don't take any risks then we'll[N]
eventually run out of supplies[..][AN]
Then the terrors will just hunt[N]
us down[.,] unless we starve to[N]
death in the meantime[..][AN]
You said there wasn't many[N]
monsters there right[.?][A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah mostly just a pack of[N]
shamblers[..] Should be easy[..][A]

[OpenFarRight]
Alright[.,] seems reasonable[..][N]
Let's make our way there[..][AN]
Keep your heads down[.,] you never[N]
know if there's terrors in the woods[..][A][X]
