Oh[.,] what's this[.?] Surprised[N]
nobody has looted it.[A][X]

## Chapter1BeginningSceneA

[OpenRight][LoadTrystan][OpenFarRight][LoadEnea][OpenMidLeft][LoadIva]
[OpenRight][OneLineBox]
So[.,] find anything Iva?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
We might be in luck[.,] I saw[N]
some old logging hamlet.[AN]
There's a few terrors roaming[N]
around[.,] but nothing too serious.[AN]
It might have some supplies that[N]
people haven't scrounged yet.[A]

[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Sounds like a good opportunity[.,][N]
if there's terrors around[.,] it might[N]
not have been picked clean yet.[A]

[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Are you sure this is[N]
a good idea[.,] Trystan?[AN]
Last time[.,] we didn't come[N]
up with much of anything.[A]

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
I'm not sure Enea[.,] but who[N]
knows what they've got.[AN]
Its hard to pass up[.,] they could[N]
have just the supplies we need.[A]

[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]
But if they don't[.,] then we'll[N]
risk getting killed by terrors[N]
without any good reason.[AN]
I just don't want any of us[N]
to get hurt for nothing.[A]

[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
I think we have to try[.,] if we[N]
don't take any risks[.,] then we'll[N]
eventually run out of supplies.[AN]
Then the terrors will just hunt[N]
us down[.,] unless we starve to[N]
death in the meantime.[AN]
I get how you feel though[N]
Enea[.,] I don't like it either.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
You said there wasn't many[N]
monsters there[.,] right?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[.,] just a pack of shamblers[.,][ToggleSmile][N]
should be easy pickings.[A]

[OpenRight][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Alright[.,] seems reasonable[.,][N]
Matteo[.,] Dayton[.,] you[N]
catch all of that?[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMatteo][OpenLeft][LoadDayton]
[OpenFarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Sure did[.,] kinda wish it wasn't[N]
more monsters[.,] but I shouldn't[N]
be surprised about that.[A]

[OpenLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Speak for yourself[.,] terrors are[N]
predictable[.,] It's people you have[N]
to really worry about[.,] I think.[A]

[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Just don't get too comfortable[N]
with them[.,] alright Dayton?[A]

[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
Let's get moving[.,] don't want to sit here[N]
too long[..] Keep your heads down though[.,] never[N]
know when there's terrors in the bushes.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][X]

## Chapter1BeginningSceneB1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMatteo][OpenLeft][LoadIva][OpenRight][LoadEnea][OpenFarRight][LoadTrystan]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well[.,] looks like this is it[..][N]
Hopefully the terrors here have[N]
put off any other looters.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Looks like you were right Iva[.,][N]
there ain't many of em'.[A][X]

## Chapter1BeginningSceneB2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMatteo][OpenLeft][LoadIva][OpenRight][LoadEnea][OpenFarRight][LoadTrystan]
[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright then[.,] make sure you check[N]
all the ruins for any supplies.[AN]
We haven't got time to sit around[.,][N]
so we'll need to loot while we fight.[AN]
And be careful not to get injured[.,][N]
those wounds will stick with you.[A][X]

## Chapter1BeginningSceneB3
[OpenMidRight][LoadTrystan][OpenMidLeft][LoadEnea]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Ah[.,] looks like we were noticed.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Damn[.,] alright[.,] lets wipe[N]
out these ghouls quickly.[AN]
Don't want to still be here if[N]
any more roaming packs show up.[A][X]

## Chapter1HintText
[OpenMidRight][LoadIva][ToggleSmile]
Hmm[Beat] I wonder what's in that[N]
house[.,] better check it out.[A][X]

## Chapter1WarningText

[MidRight][LoadTrystan]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The monsters look aggressive[.,][N]
I think they might charge soon.[A][X]

## Chapter1EndingSceneA
[MidRight][LoadTrystan]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I think that's it[.,] lets regroup.[A][X]

## Chapter1EndingSceneBa
[OpenFarLeft][LoadEnea][OpenLeft][LoadIva][OpenRight][LoadTrystan][OpenFarRight][LoadMatteo]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright that's the last of[N]
them[.,] what are we looking like?[A]

[OpenLeft][TwoLineBox]
Some pretty good pickings I'd[N]
say[.,] even found a gem here,[AN]
might be able to hawk it for some[N]
gold if we find a trader.[AN]
And I even found some[N]
tools we could use at camp.[AN]
It's much better than a lot [N]
of our recent hauls.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Pretty much everywhere is picked[N]
clean around here these days.[AN]
It might be worth thinking about[N]
making a move sooner or later.[A]

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
I'd rather it didn't come to[N]
that[.,] but you might be right.[AN]
Either way[.,] we should probably think[N]
about getting back to the others.[A]

[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[.,] longer we stick around the[N]
likelier more will show up.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Let's just hope we get back before[N]
dark[.,] I really don't want to run[N]
into any monsters at night.[A][X]

## Chapter1EndingSceneBb

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright that's the last of[N]
them[.,] what are we looking like?[A]

[OpenLeft][TwoLineBox]
We came out alright yeah[.,] it[N]
was hard to loot mid fight but-[AN]
I did at least manage to find some[N]
tools we could use at camp.[AN]
It's not much[.,] but it's better[N]
than some of our recent hauls.[A]

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright that's the last of[N]
them[.,] what are we looking like?[A]

[OpenLeft][TwoLineBox]
It isn't that great unfortunately[.,][N]
couldn't grab much of anything.[AN]
I did at least manage to find some[N]
tools we could use at camp.[AN]
It's not much[.,] about the same[N]
as some of our recent hauls.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
