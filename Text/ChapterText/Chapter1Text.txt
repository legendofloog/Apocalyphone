## Chapter1BeginningSceneA

[OpenRight][LoadGilliam][OpenFarRight][LoadFranz][OpenMidLeft][LoadMoulder]
[OpenRight][OneLineBox]
So[.,] find anything Name?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
We might be in luck[.,] I saw[N]
some old logging hamlet.[AN]
There's a few terrors roaming[N]
around[.,] but nothing too serious.[AN]
It might have some supplies that[N]
people haven't scrounged yet.[A]

[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]
At least it isn't bandits[..][N]
Monsters are predictable[.,][N]
they always want you dead.[AN]
People though[.?] You never know[N]
what they might be thinking[.,] and[N]
it never feels good to fight em'.[A]

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Speak for yourself Name[.,] you can[N]
reason with people y'know?[AN]
The monsters just make me wonder[N]
if the Gods are still alive.[A]

[OpenFarFarRight][TwoLineBox]
You're sure there's going[N]
to be supplies Name?[A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMoulder][OpenLeft][LoadGilliam][OpenRight][LoadSeth][OpenFarRight][LoadLord]
[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I mean is that ever a guarantee[.?][N]
But if there is I can find it.[A]

[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
But if there isn't[.,] then we'll[N]
risk getting killed by terrors[N]
without finding anything.[AN]

[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I think we have to try[.,] if we[N]
don't take any risks then we'll[N]
eventually run out of supplies.[AN]
Then the terrors will just hunt[N]
us down[.,] unless we starve to[N]
death in the meantime.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
You said there wasn't many[N]
monsters there right?[A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[.,] just a pack of[N]
shamblers[.,] should be easy.[A]

[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright[.,] seems reasonable[..][N]
Let's make our way there.[AN]
Keep your heads down[.,] you never[N]
know if there's terrors in the woods.[A][X]

## Chapter1BeginningSceneB1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFranz][OpenLeft][LoadMoulder][OpenRight][LoadSeth][OpenFarRight][LoadLord]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well[.,] looks like this is it[..][N]
Hopefully the terrors here[N]
have put off any other looters.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Looks like you were right Name[.,][N]
there ain't many of em'.[A][X]

## Chapter1BeginningSceneB2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFranz][OpenLeft][LoadMoulder][OpenRight][LoadSeth][OpenFarRight][LoadLord]
[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Alright then[.,] we just need to sweep[N]
the place[..] Check any buildings you[N]
find[.,] grab any medicine or weapons.[AN]
make sure to clear out any terrors[.,][N]
can't loot the place with all[N]
those revenants crawling around.[A][X]

## Chapter1BeginningSceneB3
[OpenMidRight][LoadLord][OpenMidLeft][LoadSeth]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Ah[.,] looks like we were noticed.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Damn[.,] alright[.,] lets wipe[N]
out these ghouls quickly.[AN]
Don't want to still be here if[N]
any more roaming packs show up.[A][X]

## Chapter1WarningText

[MidRight][LoadLord]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The monsters look aggressive[.,][N]
I think they might charge soon.[A][X]

## Chapter1EndingSceneA
[MidRight][LoadLord]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I think that's it[.,] lets regroup.[A][X]

## Chapter1EndingSceneBa
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSeth][OpenLeft][LoadMoulder][OpenRight][LoadLord][OpenFarRight][LoadFranz]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright that's the last of[N]
them[..] What are we looking like?[A]

[OpenLeft][TwoLineBox]
Some pretty good pickings I'd[N]
say[.,] even found a gem here.[AN]
Might be able to hawk it for some[N]
gold if we find a trader.[AN]
I even managed to find some[N]
tools we could use at camp.[AN]
It's much but it's better than[N]
a lot of our recent hauls.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Pretty much everywhere is picked[N]
clean around here these days.[AN]
It might be worth thinking about[N]
making a move sooner or later.[A]

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
I'd rather it didn't come to[N]
that[.,] but you might be right.[AN]
Either way[.,] we should probably[N]
think about getting a move on.[A]

[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[.,] longer we stick around the[N]
likelier more will show up.[A]

[OpenFarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Let's just hope we get back before[N]
dark[.,] we don't want to run[N]
into any monsters at night.[A][X]

## Chapter1EndingSceneBb

[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright that's the last of[N]
them[..] What are we looking like?[A]

[OpenLeft][TwoLineBox]
We came out alright yeah[.,] it[N]
was hard to loot mid fight but-[AN]
I did at least manage to find some[N]
tools we could use at camp.[AN]
It's not much but it's better[N]
than some of our recent hauls.[A]

Alright that's the last of[N]
them[..] What are we looking like?[A]

[OpenLeft][TwoLineBox]
It isn't that great unfortunately[.,][N]
couldn't grab much of anything.[AN]
I did at least manage to find some[N]
tools we could use at camp.[AN]
It's not much[.,] about the same[N]
as some of our recent hauls.[A]
