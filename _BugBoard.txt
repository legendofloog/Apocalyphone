Major Bugs:
- Noticed an interaction where an axe pegasus attacking at wta against a solider or freelancer is countered and then broken. Even though the opponent is supposed to double after the miss it doesnt.

Minor Bugs:
- Droppable/Stealable Graphic appears when silencing a unit.
- S Rank doesnt go epic green
- Summon (and possibly other actions) giving too much exp in fatigue state when a 1HP unit so the logic somewhere in my CHAX is probably bad.
- HP resets when escaping, this is inherent to Ysor's hack but may be worth trying to fix.
- Enemies with negative autolevels at level 1 seem to be randomly underflowing to cap 15 magic despite code flooring at 0.
- Everyone can use stupid flippin iron dagger
- Occasional HP bar graphical glitch with units missing HP in preps
