Major Bugs:
- Broadsword seems to be effective against armoured units. Also seems to be dealing x4 damage?

Minor Bugs:
- Droppable/Stealable Graphic appears when silencing a unit.
- S Rank doesnt go epic green
- Summon (and possibly other actions) giving too much exp in fatigue state when a 1HP unit so the logic somewhere in my CHAX is probably bad.
- Bow Knight anim hangs when using the shortbow at 1 range.
- HP resets when escaping, this is inherent to Ysor's hack but may be worth trying to fix.
