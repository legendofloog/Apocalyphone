Major Bugs:
- Noticed an interaction where an axe pegasus attacking at wta against a solider or freelancer is countered and then broken. Even though the opponent is supposed to double after the miss it doesnt.
- Enemies with negative autolevels are underflowing on Mag specifically on normal and easy.

Minor Bugs:
- Droppable/Stealable Graphic appears when silencing a unit.
- Wrong icon or palette for crit warning?
- S Rank doesnt go epic green
- Summon (and possibly other actions) giving too much exp in fatigue state when a 1HP unit so the logic somewhere in my CHAX is probably bad.
- HP resets when escaping, this is inherent to Ysor's hack but may be worth trying to fix.
- Everyone can use stupid flippin iron dagger
- Occasional HP bar graphical glitch with units missing HP in preps
- Dracozombie can't use wretched air for some reason?
